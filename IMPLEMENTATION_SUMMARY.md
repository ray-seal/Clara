   - User taps "üì∑ Add Image" button
   - App requests gallery permission if needed
   - User selects image from gallery
   - Image appears in preview area
   - User selects categories
   - User taps "Post" (button shows "Posting..." during upload)
   - Image uploads to Firebase Storage
   - Post saves to Firestore with image URL
   - UI resets for next post

   - Posts with images show the image above the text
   - Posts without images appear as before
