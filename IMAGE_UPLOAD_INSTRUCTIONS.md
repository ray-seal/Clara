    match /post_images/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### For Developers

#### Key Files Modified:
- `PublicFeedActivity.java` - Main image upload logic

- `PostAdapter.java` - Image display in feed
- `activity_public_feed.xml` - Image picker UI
- `item_post.xml` - Image display layout
- `AndroidManifest.xml` - Permissions
- `app/build.gradle.kts` - Dependencies

#### Firebase Storage Structure:
```
gs://your-project.appspot.com/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ post_images/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userId_timestamp1.jpg
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userId_timestamp2.jpg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

#### Error Handling:
- Permission requests for gallery access
- Image upload failure handling  
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid image selection

## Testing
1. Run the app in an Android emulator or device
2. Navigate to Public Feed
3. Try creating posts with and without images
4. Verify images appear correctly in the feed
5. Test with different image sizes and formats

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple image support per post
- Camera integration for taking photos
- Image compression before upload
- Offline image caching
- Image editing capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Images not uploading**: Check Firebase Storage rules and authentication
2. **Images not displaying**: Verify Glide dependency and network connectivity  
3. **Permission denied**: Ensure READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is granted
4. **Build errors**: Clean project and rebuild, ensure all dependencies are properly added

### Debug Steps:
1. Check Firebase console for uploaded images
2. Review Android logs for error messages
3. Verify Firebase Storage rules allow read/write access
4. Test with different image formats (JPEG, PNG)
